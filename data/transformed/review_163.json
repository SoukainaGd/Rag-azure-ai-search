  "review_text": "Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!",
